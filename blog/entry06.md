## context
During this part of the year I have finished my freedom project with my partner and we have finished our mvp and beyond mvp. We have also presented our project at the expo. Explaing each step of the project from start to finish. Our project is composed of kaboom.js and a topic about a cooking game. I learned the main functions of kaboom.js on the [kaboom website] (https://kaboomjs.com/), on the playground. I spent a lot of time learning how each code runs together to create the final game.
