My learning tool is Kaboom.js and so far ive been learning how to create a simple 



## context
For this year-long project I decided to use the tool Kaboom. Kaboom is a game engine where you can make 2D games. My backup tool was three.js which is another tool for making games. Aftering doing my learning logs I decided to stay with kaboom as my tool. The reason I decided on kaboom is because it feels just right for my skill level and it has been a really fun tool to use. For kaboom I was planning on making a game and working with Johnny. We decided to make a cooking game. This connects to last year where I made a website for cooking. Cooking is something I am passionate about so this year we will make a cooking game. The purpose of my game is for people to get an understanding of how cooking works, if you have never cooked before and are too scared to do this game would be perfect. So for both LL1 and LL2 I have tinkerin many ways. 


[kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you can see how different codes are used and you can see the games that they made. This is where I do most of my tinkering and find codes that could help for the future. Another thing I used I was youtube videos like [making a game with Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU) [learning log.md](../tool/learning-log.md). 
   
## EDP 
EDP or Engineering Design Process is the part of the project you are on. There are 8 different parts. The problem I am trying to solve is people being too scared to cook. I plan on making a game that everyone can enjoy and not be scared of cooking. You can learn many things like how to cook, different recipes and have fun with friends in general. I finished my define and research part of the EDp, I am on the brainstorming and planning part where I need to think of how I can make a website and ways this game can make being have fun and learn how to cook.
