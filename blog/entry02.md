This year we have our Sep 11 freedom project where I have been learning code using kaboom. My learning tool is Kaboom.js and so far I’ve been using it and learning a lot about it through my Learning Logs. I have been trying out different codes and experimenting with making a cooking game. My partner is Johnny Yang and together we are working on making a fun RPG cooking game where you can explore the world and enjoy cooking. The way we've been learning our codes are from the websites. One of these website is the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you can see how different codes are used and you can see the games that they made. This is where I do most of my tinkering and find codes that could help for the future. Another thing I used I was youtube videos like [making a game with Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU) [learning log.md](../tool/learning-log.md). This is the learning log which is where my notes are for these codes I learned. Some of these code I learned was:


   
## EDP 
EDP or Engineering Design Process is the part of the project you are on. There are 8 different parts. The problem I am trying to solve is people being too scared to cook. I plan on making a game that everyone can enjoy and not be scared of cooking. You can learn many things like how to cook, different recipes and have fun with friends in general. I finished my define and research part of the EDp, I am on the brainstorming and planning part where I need to think of how I can make a website and ways this game can make being have fun and learn how to cook.

I have learned many skills while working on this project. Some of which is communication and testing codes.

### Communication 

Communication is one of the most important skills to learn, you have to communicate with many people. SinceI have a partner I need to communicate and talk to them about what we should do for the project. Also how we should do it. Another thing that is importing is asking my friends for help, this is developing my communication skills and will help me when I get a job.



### Testing codes 

Testing code isn’t a thing I used to do. However, I learned that testing codes is a really important skill to learn. You should always be brave and try code. When something doesn’t work you should always try it and keep trying until you get it. This is something I have been doing for the Learning Log. I will keep being brave a test code for the future of this game.
