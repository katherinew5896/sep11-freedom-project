This year we had the freedom project, our year-long project for Sep. I have been learning the tool I used which is kaboom in many ways. As I said before one of these websites for learning is the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you can see how different codes are used and you can see the games that they made. This is where I do most of my tinkering and find codes that could help in the future. Another thing I used for learning was YouTube videos like [making a game with Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU) [learning log.md](../tool/learning-log.md).

We have reached the end of this project, which in my blog 5, I will talk about the progress we have made, what we have achieved, and many more. The code and pictures of is down:
