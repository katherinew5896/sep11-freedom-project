This year we have our Sep 11 freedom project where I have been learning code using kaboom. My learning tool is Kaboom.js and so far Iâ€™ve been using it and learning a lot about it through my Learning Logs. I have been trying out different codes and experimenting with making a cooking game. My partner is Johnny Yang and together we are working on making a fun RPG cooking game where you can explore the world and enjoy cooking. The way we've been learning our codes are from the websites. One of these websites is the [kaboom website](https://kaboomjs.com/) in this website you can see how different codes are used and you can see the games that they made. This is where I do most of my tinkering and find codes that could help for the future. Another thing I used was youtube videos like [making a game with Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU) [learning log.md](../tool/learning-log.md). This is the learning log which is where my notes are for these codes I learned. Some of these code I learned was:
