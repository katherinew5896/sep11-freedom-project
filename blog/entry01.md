## Context
For this year-long project I decided to use the tool Kaboom. Kaboom is a game engine where you can make 2D games. My backup tool was two.js which is another tool for making games. Aftering doing my learning logs I decided to stay with kaboom as my tool. the reason I decided on kaboom is because it feels just right for my skill level and it has been a really fun tool to use. For kaboom I was planning on making a game and working with Johnny. We decided to make a cooking game. This connects to last year where I made a website for cooking. Cooking is something I am passionate about so this year we will make a cooking game. The purposes of my game to the world, is for people get a understanding of how cooking works, if you never cooked before and are too scared to this game would be perfect. So for both LL1 and LL2 I have tinkerin many ways.
