## Context
For this year-long project I decided to use the tool kaboom. My backup tool was two.js. For kaboom I was planning on making a game and working with Johnny. We decided to make a cooking game. This connects to last year where I made a website for cooking. Cooking is something I am passionate about so this year we will make a cooking game. So for both LL1 and LL2 I was tinkering in many ways. 
Examples of my tinkering
